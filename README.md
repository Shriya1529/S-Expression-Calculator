# S-Expression-Calculator: 
The provided code implements a simple S-expression calculator in Python. S-expressions are evaluated by recursively parsing and processing the nested components. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can handle numeric literals and nested expressions. By providing an S-expression, the code evaluates and returns the result. The implementation utilizes Python's operator module for arithmetic operations and recursively evaluates the expressions. The code can be extended to support additional operators or more complex S-expressions based on specific requirements.
